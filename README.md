# kociemba
Here you can find two equivalent implementations (in C and Python) of Herbert Kociemba's two-phase algorithm for solving Rubik's Cube.
Original Java implementation can be found here: http://kociemba.org/download.htm.

These ports are pretty straightforward (not to say dumb) and most probably can be optimized.

## C version
C sources reside in the ```ckociemba``` folder. Running ```make``` in a root folder will compile a binary called ```solve```. It accepts a cube representation as a commandline argument, and writes the solution to the standard output. You can, of course, use it as a library.

## Python version
Python version is located in ```kociemba``` directory. It is quite slow. It is probably better just to use Python's subprocess module and run a compiled C version. However, if you want pure Python, I would recommend running it with PyPy. On my Raspberry Pi version B it takes up to one minute to find a solution for a single cube.

## Testing
In the root directory you can find a test script that contains some tests, generated by the original Java implementation. Run it like this:

```$ python test.py```

There is also a bigger test file called javares.txt. You can feed it to the test.py:

```$ python test.py javares.txt```
